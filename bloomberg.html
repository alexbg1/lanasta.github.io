						<h5><strong>Who am I?</strong></h5>
						<h5> I am Anastasia Lalamentik, a junior transfer student majoring in Computer Science.
						I am an international student from Jakarta, Indonesia. I have lived in the United States
						for almost 3 years now. I lived in Charlotte for two years to get my Associate's degree
						in Science. Before coming to Charlotte, I lived in Singapore for roughly five years.</h5>
						<h5><strong>What are my hobbies and interests outside of work?</strong></h5>
						<h5> I like learning to play different
						musical instruments and I have recently developed a hobby of going to the beautiful mountains situated around North Carolina
						to enjoy the beautiful scenery. I also enjoy travelling to new places. As of today,
						I have lived in four different cities located in three different countries.
						</h5>
						<h5><strong>In a work environment, what are your best qualities/strengths?</strong></h5>
						<h5>I consider myself a good listener, but I also make sure
						that I share my ideas with people I work with. I am responsible, helpful and eager
						to learn new things. I am constantly looking for things to improve on in my work.  
						I see criticism as a good opportunity for me to become better at what I do.
						I am highly purpose-oriented; I dedicate a great level of focus and time when I see a good 
						cause in the job that I am doing.
						</h5>
						<h5><strong>Why did I choose to apply to the the Technical Operations Internship at Bloomberg?</strong></h5>
						<h5>
						I want to be immersed in an environment which thrives through innovation and creativity, 
						and I believe that Bloomberg has that. I appreciate the diversity that Bloomberg has, 
						and find that even though it is the one quality that a lot of companies claim to have, 
						not many actually follow through. I say this because I recently met a Bloomberg representative at VTHacks(a hackathon at Virginia Tech),
						a non-U.S. Citizen who told me about Bloomberg's friendly attitude towards foreign candidates.
						I also believe that I am qualified for this internship, since I am experienced in a few programming languages.
						In addition to that, I am a native speaker of the Indonesian language. Being an intern at Bloomberg
						will be such a great privilege to me.
						</h5>
